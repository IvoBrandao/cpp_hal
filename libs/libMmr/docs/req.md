# Requirements

1. **Requirement:** The code shall provide the ability to create a memory-mapped register of a specified size (in bits) and access type (Read-Only, Write-Only, or Read-Write).
   - **Rationale:** This feature allows users to define and configure memory-mapped registers to interact with hardware peripherals according to specific requirements.

2. **Requirement:** The code shall support bit-level manipulation of registers.
   - **Rationale:** Bit-level manipulation is essential for controlling individual bits within registers, which is a common task in embedded systems programming for configuring hardware settings and status flags.

3. **Requirement:** The code shall support reading the value of a register.
   - **Rationale:** Reading register values is fundamental for retrieving status information and configuration settings from hardware peripherals.

4. **Requirement:** The code shall support writing a value to a register.
   - **Rationale:** Writing values to registers is necessary for configuring and controlling hardware peripherals, allowing users to set specific states or parameters.

5. **Requirement:** The code shall support increment and decrement operations on registers.
   - **Rationale:** Increment and decrement operations are useful for tasks like counting and configuring hardware settings where values need to change in a controlled manner.

6. **Requirement:** The code shall support addition and subtraction operations on registers.
   - **Rationale:** Arithmetic operations are important for performing calculations and updates within hardware registers, enabling complex control and signal processing tasks.

7. **Requirement:** The code shall support bitwise logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) on registers.
   - **Rationale:** Bitwise operations are critical for configuring individual bits within a register and performing logical operations on hardware status flags, allowing for advanced control and decision-making.

8. **Requirement:** The code shall support conversion from an enum class to its underlying type.
   - **Rationale:** This functionality is helpful when using enumerated values to configure registers, facilitating the translation of human-readable values into machine-understandable formats.

9. **Requirement:** The code shall provide options for enabling or disabling debug prints.
   - **Rationale:** Debug prints are essential for diagnosing issues and understanding code behavior during development and debugging, and users should have control over their verbosity.

10. **Requirement:** The code shall perform bounds checking when accessing bits in a register.
    - **Rationale:** Bounds checking ensures code robustness by preventing out-of-bounds access to register bits, which could lead to unintended side effects or data corruption.

11. **Requirement:** The code shall provide a convenient way to retrieve the memory address of a register.
    - **Rationale:** Knowing the memory address is necessary when directly interfacing with hardware peripherals using memory-mapped registers.

12. **Requirement:** The code shall allow users to set the memory address of a register.
    - **Rationale:** Allowing users to set the memory address of a register is crucial for configuring memory-mapped registers to match the hardware's memory map.

13. **Requirement:** The code shall use type traits to determine the primitive data type for registers of different sizes.
    - **Rationale:** Type traits provide compile-time information about the register's data type, ensuring type safety and efficient memory usage in a flexible and generic manner.

14. **Requirement:** The code shall include comprehensive documentation in Doxygen style.
    - **Rationale:** Clear and detailed Doxygen-style documentation enhances code usability and maintainability by providing information on how to use the code, its purpose, and the rationale behind design decisions.

15. **Requirement:** The code shall handle volatile pointers correctly for memory-mapped register access.
    - **Rationale:** Correctly handling volatile pointers is crucial to ensure that memory-mapped register access remains predictable and reliable in the presence of asynchronous changes, preventing compiler optimizations that could affect register access.
